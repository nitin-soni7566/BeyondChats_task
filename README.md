# BeyondChats Task

## API to Fetch Data from All Pages

I have created an API to fetch data from all pages from the Task API endpoint. I used FastAPI to create the `/citation` endpoint.

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository to your system.
2. Open a terminal in the repository directory.
3. Run `poetry shell`.
4. Run `poetry install`.
5. Start the server with `uvicorn src.main:app --reload`.
6. Follow the link: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
7. For API documentation, visit: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).

## Dependency Management

I used the Poetry package manager to install dependencies.
